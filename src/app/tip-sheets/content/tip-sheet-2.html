      It's hard to feel positive when our kids or teenagers are driving us
      crazy. We often end up saying "Stop doing that!" But children are much
      more likely to do what we ask if we give them positive instructions and
      lots of praise for what they do right

    <h2 translate>Say the behaviour you want to see</h2>
    <p translate>
      Use positive words when telling your child what to do; like 'Please put
      your clothes away' (instead of 'Don't make a mess')
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2>It's all in the delivery</h2>
    <p>
      Shouting at your child will just make you and them more stressed and
      angrier. Get your child's attention by using their name. Speak in a calm
      voice.

    <h2>Get real</h2>
    <p>
      Can your child actually do what you are asking them? It is very hard for a
      child to keep quiet inside for a whole day but maybe they can keep quiet
      for 15 minutes while you are on a call.

    <h2>Praise your child when they are behaving well</h2>
    <p>
      Try praising your child or teenager for something they have done well.
      They may not show it, but you'll see them doing that good thing again. It
      will also reassure them that you notice and care.

    <h2>Help your teen stay connected</h2>
    <p>
      Teens especially need to be able to communicate with their friends. Help
      your teen connect through social media and other safe distancing ways.
      This is something you can do together, too!
