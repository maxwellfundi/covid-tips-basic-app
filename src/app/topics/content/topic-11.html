    <h2 translate>It is OK not to know the answers</h2>

      It is fine to say "We don't know, but we are working on it; or we don't
      know, but we think." Use this as an opportunity to learn something new
      with your child!

      Explain that Demo-1-19 has nothing to do with the way someone looks, where
      they are from, or what language they speak. Tell your child that we can be
      compassionate to people who are sick and those who are caring for them.
      Look for stories of people who are working to stop the outbreak and are
      caring for sick people.

      Check to see if your child is okay. Remind them that you care and that
      they can they can talk to you anytime. Then do something fun together!
