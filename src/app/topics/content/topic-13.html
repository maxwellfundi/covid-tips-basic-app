  <h2>Be supportive,
  empathetic,
  and loving.</h2>
  <ul>
   <li> Your child may not have the
    same support they usually
    have, and this can lead to
    additional challenges such as
    increased stress, anxiety, and
    frustration.</li>

   <li> Use physical and verbal
    support to make your child feel
    accepted and loved.</li>

    <li> Positive body language,
    gestures, and words make a big
    difference!</li> 
  </ul>
  <h2>Communicating
    with your child.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Get down to your child’s level
        when communicating with
        your child.</li>

        <li>Maintain eye contact, a positive
          attitude.</li>

        <li>Take your time to allow your
            child the space to communicate.</li>

            <li>Observe, listen to, and confirm
              that you understand your child.</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Reinforce the
            positive!</h2> 
            <ul>
              <li>Reinforce strengths with praise
                and stimulate their abilities
                rather than highlight the things
                they cannot do.</li>

                <li>Only help children when they
                  need it. Too much support denies
                  them the chance to become
                  independent and can feel
                  patronising.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h2>Ask for help if you
                  can.</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Share the load with other adult family
                      members.</li>

                      <li>You are not alone! Keep
                        connected with people who
                        understand your situation. Share your
                        challenges AND your successes.</li>

                        <li>It is normal to feel stressed,
                          frustrated, and afraid at this time.</li>

                          <li> kind to yourself and take a
                            break when you need to!
                            Tip sheets “When We Get Angry” and
                            “Keep Calm and Manage Stress” have
                            some helpful advice.</li>
</ul>
<div class="purple-bg">
  <h2>Strengthen routines</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>Routines help children feel secure and
    safe. See tip sheet, “Structure Up!” for
    more info</li>

    <li>iCreate a daily routine with activities that
      are familiar to your child and include
      some of their favourite activities.</li>

      <li> Help your child connect to friends
      and family members via phone chats,
      writing cards, or drawing pictures.</li>

      <li>Provide your child with choices so that
        they have a sense of control. This also
        increases self-esteem.</li>

        <li>Use simple language and clear
          instructions and nonverbal
          communication for children who
          need it (for example: gestures,
          pictures, and visual aids)</li>
